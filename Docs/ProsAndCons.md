# Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Allows for subviews to access the navigation stack itself | Will require refactoring for anything that uses `NavigationView` |
| Can make progrommatic navigation a bit easier | `NavigaitonView` will be **deprecated** with the release of iOS 16 |
| Decent documentation from Apple | Not a lot of help online at the moment since it hasn't been officially released yet |
| Can make navigating to a default carrier/vehicle on app start a bit easier | Since it is new, there will be lots of questions and maybe not so many answers right away |
